# GAN config for MELO-GAN (integration with AE)
INTEGRATION_MODE: "conditioning"   # "conditioning" or "warm_start"
# conditioning mode when we are using the AE’s latent vectors to GAN during training
# warm_start mode when we are directly init the GAN weights from the AE, this may also induce noise in the GAN
